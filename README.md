# Welcome to my picoCTF archive!
this github repo is made with an intend to archive my WRITEUPs of any capture the flag
challenges of any type inside picoCTF that i have completed thus far as well as files
related to the process of solving the challenge. 
this also serves as some sort of "progression bookmark" for myself to be able 
to look back and learn from it should i forgot any knowledge i have gained from it.
