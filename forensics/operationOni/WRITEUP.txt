use mmls to look into partion of the disk image

$ mmls disk.img

we can see the location of linux file system,etc will be in the 
second partion so we can get in and into the root folder and grab the content of ssh file 

//look into partition
fls -o 206848 disk.img 

//look into root/ directory
fls -o 206848 disk.img 470

//into ssh folder
fls -o 206848 disk.img 3916

//extract data from id file at address 2345 into text file
icat -o 206848 disk.img 2345 > id_ed25519

after getting the ssh key we need to make the file's permission inaccessible to any user 
but root so we need to chmod it then insert it into ssh command

//change permission
chmod -v 700 id_ed25519

//ssh into operationOni machine
**dont forget to put the file name after ' -i ' 
ssh -i id_ed25519 -p 51591 ctf-player@saturn.picoctf.net

then just use ls and cat to grab the flag out of the text file

**progress note
i thought it needed password for after ssh at first so i search for shadow file and tried to decrypt it with john and it didnt work 
so i have to look up WRITEUP to realize that i was WAY off the mark
