once inspecting pcap file we can see from tcp message that 
file is sent through port 9000 so with "tcp.port == 9000"
we can find one packet with salted__ in data which we can copy as 
hex stream and insert into textfile
we can also see the command use to decrypt the file in one of message
in pcap package which we can use to get the flag,we first need to turn 
salted data into binary file using  "xxd -r -p salt.txt file.des3"
then we can use the command "openssl des3 -d -salt -in file.des3 -out out.txt -k supersecretpassword123" we founded to get the flag

**it is wrong,at least the last section is. dunno what goes wrong tho
even flag from many source are differed and incorrect so,that's that
