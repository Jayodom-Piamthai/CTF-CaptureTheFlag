this challenge present a pcap file that contains the flag which we can find by filtering the http protocol in the file with wireshark
there will be one package that transfer text data as follow

Gur synt vf cvpbPGS{c33xno00_1_f33_h_qrnqorrs}

this is a cypher text,a ceasar cipher with 13 space displacement(maybe a wrong word to describe)
put it in any decipher and we will get this flag

The flag is picoCTF{p33kab00_1_s33_u_deadbeef}

**after note**
even though this is a medium dificulty challenge it kinda feels like an easy one with how simple it is
