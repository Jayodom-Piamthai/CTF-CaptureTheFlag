                        <div class="content">That is sexual harassment. He is rude and vulgar and he could go to jail for that, it&#039;s called assault.<br>
You do not have to accept that kind of behavior from ANYONE, please!  You sound too nice, honey, you should have knocked him out of his pants with a big punch to his face, or started yelling for help while hitting him.  (If you defend yourself from being assaulted, no one can do anything to you.) But since you didn&#039;t knock him out, here&#039;s what you do:<br>
You should tell your father or mother--you sound very young and should not have to deal with this alone.  Have them call his parents and have a sit down with the octopus.  If you don&#039;t know where to start, show them your question and this answer and ask them what they think.<br>
If parents are out of touch or unable (or unwilling) go to the teacher or counselor at school you trust the most or who has a reputation for being a helping soul.  Trust me, they have seen it all.<br>
Tell your boyfriend after you have talked to you parents or the teacher, preferably with one of them there. (His friend will try to convince him it was YOU who started it.  If you have serious backup, he&#039;ll know better.  If he doesn&#039;t--dump him)<br>
Stay out of this guy&#039;s way.  He&#039;s in trouble and will probably end up in prison or sued one day.<br>
